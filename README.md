Competitive Programming Code


- Think about number of states - too much recursion? - Use bottom up.
- Final check if memoised before trying
- Remember to & any arguments for memory especially for recursive.
- Check need for longs
- GDB:
``` 
    bt (backtrace call stack)
    p [varname] (variable)
    run < [filename]
```
- May be able to use deque instead of bst if only want max min and vals come in right order
